#### Configuration

The script uses status names to determine ticket state. You'll need to edit the `CONFIG` object at the top of the script to match your Jira workflow:

```javascript
const CONFIG = {
    STALE_THRESHOLD_DAYS: 30,      // Days without updates before "Stale"
    PING_PONG_MIN_AGE_DAYS: 14,    // Days old before "Stuck" (never started)
    STUCK_IN_STATUS_DAYS: 14,      // Days in same status before "Stuck in Status"
    PROGRESS_STATUSES: [           // Statuses that mean work has started
        'In Progress',
        'Tech Review',
        'Merged',
        'Testing',
        'Ready for Release'
    ],
    DONE_STATUSES: [               // Statuses that mean work is complete
        'Done',
        'Done (deployed to prod)',
        'Closed'
    ]
};
```

**Important:** Update `PROGRESS_STATUSES` and `DONE_STATUSES` to match the exact status names in your Jira project. The script uses these to determine:
- Whether a ticket has ever been worked on (for "Stuck" detection)
- Whether to skip completed tickets
- Which statuses trigger "Stuck in Status" warnings
